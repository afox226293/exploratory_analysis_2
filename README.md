# Explotatory Data Analysis
## Final project for the Exploratory Data Analysis course (part of the Data Science track on Coursera)
### Readme
The aim of this project is to analyse data on the emissions of fine particulate matter in the United States over a period from 1999 to 2008. Data is taken from the National Emissions Inventory database.  The specfic dataset (29MB) is available [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip).

### Info
The repo contains 6 R scripts and 6 .png files.  The scripts are the code to output the image files.  Each image is a different analysis of the dataset and is summarised below.  Each script can be used independently of the other, each will access the data and create relevant directories.  As default the dataset will be saved in a subdirectory of your working directory called "data" and the plots will be saved in a subdirectory of your working directory called "plots".

#### Plots
The 6 evaluations are as follows:

##### 1
!()

The first plot looks at the total emissions (given in millions of tonnes) of fine particualte matter (PM~2.5~) across the United States for 4 individual years (1999, 2002, 2005, 2008) across a ten year period.  The graph shows a year on year decrease of total emissions.  As per the instructions of the project this is produced using base R graphics.

##### 2
!()

The second plot shows the total emissions of fine particulate matter(PM~2.5~) in tonnes over a ten year period by comparing the total emissions from all sources from four years(1999, 2002, 2005, 2008). It shows that overall there has been a decrease over the period however there was an increase between 2002 and 2005.  As per the instructions of the project this is produced using base R graphics.
